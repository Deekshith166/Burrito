Gather the ingredients.
In a large bowl, toss together cooked rice and fresh chopped cilantro, and drizzle with a bit of fresh lime juice. Heat in the microwave or on the stove just until hot, and give it a quick stir. 
In a separate large skillet, saut√© the garlic and onion in vegetable oil or olive oil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the onion is soft.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the black beans or pinto beans and season with the chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce, stirring to combine. You can add a bit of salt if you'd like, but you shouldn't need too much with all the other seasonings. Allow the beans to cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Spoon the cilantro-lime rice and the black bean mix onto lightly warmed flour tortillas, and add any additional toppings you want.
Wrap the burritos: Fold the short ends in, then fold one long side over the filling and gently push to ensure the fold is tight before rolling up the remainder of the burrito.
Cut in half, and serve immediately.
